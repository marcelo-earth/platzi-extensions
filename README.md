## 💻 Core Development

This section is for developers who want to know how Platzi Extensions works.

Platzi Extensions has a software architecture targeted to be a browser extension for the Chrome Web Store.

### ⭐️ Version Workflow

The source code in this repository is versioned at 4.0.0. The source code you can download is the latest version of **Platzi Extensions for Developers**, which may contain features that are not yet available in stores, and may contain bugs.

### 📦 Architecture

Platzi Extensions adopts an all-new architecture for browser extensions using TypeScript for the development of the modules. This enables better experience to interact with the Chrome API.

Platzi Extensions uses Webpack for the compilation of the modules written in TypeScript. Webpack is configured into two modes: `development` and `production`.

Platzi Extensions uses JSDocs for the documentation of the code.

    B --> |Check if web is Platzi| C[\matches: platzi.com/*/]
    C -->|Load Platzi Extensions default features| D(content_scripts)
```

Platzi Extensions does not store information of the users. An account is not required to use the extension.

Information related to their extension preferences is stored in the browser's storage.

### ✅ Good practices

According to the [Google Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/best_practices/), Platzi Extensions as a browser extension follows these good practices:

* **Manifest V3**: The extension uses the new Manifest V3 of Chrome.
* **Security**: The extension does not store information of the users. An account is not required to use the extension.
* **User privacy**: Information related to their extension preferences is stored in the browser's storage.
* **Performance**: The extension is optimized to be lightweight and fast.
* **User Experence**: The extension is designed to be easy to use and intuitive.


### 🔭 Control Flow

`manifest.json` file is the manifest of the extension. It contains the information of the extension and the permissions it needs.

`popup.html` file is the extension window. The `popup.js` file is the JavaScript code whose scope is in this window. It executed when the popup es opened.

`background.ts` file only contains the default storage information about the features of Platzi Extensions. It's the service worker of the extension.

`content.ts` file is executed in background everytime the page is loaded for the `"https://platzi.com/*"`

### 🔓 Browser permissions

Platzi Extensions works with these permissions:

- `storage`: To store variables like `shortcuts`, `greenboard`, etc.
- `scripting`: To execute JavaScript scripts inside the page itself.

### ⌨️ Shortcuts Technology

Platzi Extensions [creates an eventlistener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) inside window to listen for keypresses on keys `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` and `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` and `6`. Also `X` or `0` key to skip the question.

## 🔩 Installation

### 🚅 Production (recommended)

Go to [Platzi Extensions page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/platzi-extension/bdjedpeffgjikndcihipemgdinpcmpcf?hl=es-419), and click on "Add extension".

It works correctly in Google Chrome, Micorosft Edge and Brave.

## 🏛️ History

This browser extension was made with the motive of **accelerating the speed of exam taking** in Platzi inspired by the way in which Typeform structures the shortcuts of its forms.
